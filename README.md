# Sustainability Trends: Global CO₂ Emissions & Deforestation Analysis  

**A relational SQL + Power BI project exploring global inequalities in emissions and forest loss.**  
The project involved building a MySQL database, cleaning data with Python/Excel, developing metrics, KPIs and creating narrative-rich dashboards in Power BI to cut through misinformation and present clear insights.

## ✨ Why This Project?
Climate change is often discussed emotionally — some minimize it, others exaggerate it.  
I wanted to apply **business analysis skills** to sustainability data to answer one question:  

👉 *“If data can solve business problems, why can’t it also clarify the truth about climate issues?”*  

This project is my attempt to use **data storytelling** to highlight where responsibility lies and where action is most urgent.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze global CO₂ emissions and deforestation using World Bank Data.  
- Compare trends across **income groups** and **population levels**.  
- Build dashboards that are **accessible, evidence-backed, and engaging** for both technical and non-technical audiences.  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Skills Applied
- **SQL (MySQL):** Built relational schema, joins, calculated columns, and PK constraints.  
- **Python (pandas):** Cleaned raw CSV (deforestation).  
- **Excel:** Manual profiling & cleaning for other datasets.  
- **Power BI:** Data model, DAX measures, time intelligence, storytelling visuals.  
- **Accessibility & UX:** High-contrast visuals, simple navigation, alt text, readability focus.

## 🔄 Process Overview
1. **Extract** — Collected World Bank datasets on emissions, deforestation, population, land area, and income.  
2. **Transform** — Cleaned with Python & Excel; standardized headers, dropped nulls, profiled values.  
3. **Load** — Built a **MySQL relational database** with PKs (`country_code, year`) and merged fact tables.  
4. **Model** — Created a **star schema** with `Dim_Year` and fact tables (`co2_emissions`, `Deforestation`).  
5. **Visualize** — Designed a dual-page Power BI dashboard + 2025 forecast.

## 📊 Key Insights
- **The Emission Gap:**  
  - High/upper-middle income countries are responsible for most of the emissions = **82.2% of global CO₂ emissions** but only **44.5% of the world’s population**.
  - Per capita, Qatar (37.8t) and Bahrain are extreme outliers.  

- **Forest Decline:**  
  - In low and lower-middle income countries, forests are vanishing faster due to reliance on natural resource extraction for economic survival.    
  - Two-thirds of countries have <40% forest cover.
   

- **Forecasting:**  
  - By 2025, tropical nations like Brazil and Indonesia continue downward trends without major reforestation.  
  - Positive turnarounds in Vietnam, Chile, and Türkiye due to strong reforestation policies.  

---

## 📈 Visual Design
- Two themed dashboards:  
  - *The Emission Gap* (income vs emissions).  
  - *Forest Decline* (global deforestation risk).  
- Forecast chart with Power BI’s built-in analytics.  
- Accessibility-first: clear labels, high contrast colors, alt text, big-font data labels.  

---

## 💡 Lessons Learned
- **ETL matters as much as visuals** — cleaning and consistent schemas saved hours of debugging later.
-  Creating **meaningful tags** from raw parameters can lead to much richer analysis — e.g., in this project, I tagged countries by income per capita into Low / Lower-Middle / Upper-Middle / High income groups to uncover inequality patterns.
- **Storytelling > charts** — recruiters and stakeholders remember narratives, not bar charts.  

---

## 🚀 How I’d Improve It (Next Iteration) 
- Automate the full ETL pipeline with **Python scripts** instead of manual Excel cleaning.  
- Deploy dashboards to **Power BI Service** for real-time interaction instead of local PBIX.  
- Integrate **cloud SQL (AWS RDS / GCP)** for production-scale datasets.
